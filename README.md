# AssignmentRepository
-> This project is build on Clean Code Architecture along with MVVM

-> Uses Hilt for dependency injection

-> Uses Coil Library for loading images

-> Uses Moshi for parsing data

-> Uses Retrofit for data loading purpose.

-> Have used xml for now to show UI (Due to lack of time) but Jetpack compose can be used to improve the performance
